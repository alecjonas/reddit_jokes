By this time, the Judge was fairly interested in Clyde's answer and said to the lawyer, ""I'd like to hear what he has to say about his favorite cow, Bessie"".

Clyde thanked the Judge and proceeded.

I knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans.

After he looked at her, and saw her fatal condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes.

Catching up with him over the course of the evening I learned that he had gone on to become a surgeon.  So, I asked him if he could check out a lump that had grown on my wrist.  He set down his beer and and looked it over and declared, ""Why this is just a common cyst.  In fact, I could drain it for you right here, tonight!"" I drunkenly agreed, and within a few minutes there was blood everywhere. He had totally botched it!    

I needed to get sewn up, but as the surgeon rushed me off to urgent care, he begged me not to tell anyone about what really happened or he could lose his license to practice medicine.  I assured him that the whole thing was between us.    

At the hospital the physician took one look at the wound and noticed straight away that the cut was the work of a professional. He immediately asked, ""Sir, you must tell me who did this to you before I proceed with the suture. It would be irresponsible of me not to report this to the boards!""      

With my wrist still wide open, I told him that I'm sorry, but I couldn't tell. I am not a rat.

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.

On 31 December 2019, the WHO China Country Office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology (unknown cause) detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus by Chinese authorities on 7 January.

On 10 January, the WHO published a range of interim guidance for all countries on how they can prepare for this virus, including how to monitor for sick people, test samples, treat patients, control infection in health centres, maintain the right supplies, and communicate with the public about this new virus.

Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. 

Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.

Based on currently available information, the WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel or trade. Countries are encouraged to continue strengthening their preparedness for health emergencies in line with the International Health Regulations (2005).

He is assigned to helping the other monks in copying the old canons  and laws of the church by hand. He notices, however, that all of the  monks are copying from copies, not from the original manuscript.

 So, the new monk goes to the head abbot to question this, pointing out  that if someone made even a small error in the first copy, it would  never be picked up. In fact, that error would be continued in all of the subsequent copies.

 The head monk says, ""We have been copying from the copies for  centuries, but you make a good point, my son."" So, he goes down into the  dark caves underneath the monastery where the original manuscripts are  held as archives in a locked vault that hasn't been opened for hundreds  of years.

Hours go by and nobody sees the old abbot. So, the  young monk gets worried and goes down to look for him. He sees him  banging his head against the wall and wailing, ""We missed the ""R"", we  missed the ""R"". His forehead is all bloody and bruised and he is crying  uncontrollably.

The young monk asks the old abbot, ""What's wrong,  father?"" With a choking voice, the old abbot replies, ""The word was  CELEBRATE!""",A young monk arrives at the monastery.,2

The story takes place in Spain, where there’s a lot of bull fighting. When a bull is killed, it is taken to a restaurant where is is cooked and eaten. A man who is eating there asks the waiter, “What would you recommend?”

The waiter replies, “It sounds strange, but our specialty with bulls is their testicles.”

The man laughs and says, “You know what? I’ll try anything once! I’ll take an order of bull testicles, please.” When it is served, the man tries them, and to his surprise, they’re delicious and he really likes them.

The next bull fight, he comes back and once again orders the testicles. This time they’re different, though. They’re disgusting and he hates them. He asks the waiter, “What gives? These were incredible the last time I ordered them!” 

The waiter replied, “The bull won.”",My grandfather (may he rest in peace) told me this story at age 8,6

They immediately impounded the aircraft and hauled the pilot into an interrogation room. The pilot's story was that he took off from Vegas, got lost, and spotted the Base just as he was about to run out of fuel. The Air Force started a full FBI background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the investigation. By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was lost and wasn't a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a terrifying ""you-did-not-see-a-base"" briefing, complete with threats of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was that-a-way on such-and-such a heading, and sent him on his way. The day after that though, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the same Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP's surrounded the plane... Only this time there were two people in the plane.

""Mike--Mike.""

""Mike--it's me, Joe.""

""You're not Joe. Joe just died.""

""I'm telling you, it's me, Joe,"" insists the voice.""

""Joe! Where are you?""

He used this Datsun for all his farm work, feeding the horses.. Throwing bails of hay out the back of it.. Carrying firewood and what not. When all of sudden one day, chug chug chug it breaks down.

So he decides to go back to the shed to grab his tractor and tow it back. He pulls apart his Datsun Ute and does all the fault finding and diagnostics you can imagine. He pulls apart the gearbox and finds a broken cog.

So he calls up the Datsun dealership and explains to him how his Datsun Ute broke down, and he needs a new cog for it. He asks if he could help him out. The dealership tells him ""Yeh mate, I can get one in for ya but it's going to take about 6-8 weeks."" The farmer says, ""why so long? I really need the Datsun cog for my Datsun Ute."" The man replies, ""Yeh sorry mate, the parts coming from Japan, nothing I can do."" The farmer says ""fair enough"" and hangs up the phone. He comes up with the idea to just fly over there himself and pick it up, as it's costing him money not having his Datsun ute running.

He buys a plane ticket to Japan expecting he's just going to get there and buy a Datsun cog and return home. He finally lands and makes his way to the Datsun factory. Out comes one of the workers and the farmer says to him, ""Mate, I'm after a Datsun cog for my Datsun ute."" The factory worker says ""Yeh no worries, but we're a factory, you can't just buy one Datsun cog. You have to buy a 1000 Datsun cogs minimum."" The farmer agrees and he takes a pallet of a 1000 Datsun cogs back onto the plane making his way home.

As the planes descending the planes to heavy for the landing gear and the flight attendants announce their going to throw out anything they deem as excessive. The flight crew are staring at a pallet of a 1000 Datsun cogs, thinking who would want a 1000, it's a Datsun.

So they decide to push it off the back of the plane. When at that moment the farmer comes racing in saying ""stop, stop!"". He reaches into the pile and grabs a Datsun cog out. And he's happy, as he got what he came for. So they push out the remainder, like 999 Datsun cogs, but let's just say a 1000, who's counting.

So you can imagine, a 1000 Datsun cogs are falling from the sky from a plane, what a sight that would be. 2 other farmers, Billy and Joel, sitting out on their deck under a tin roof see exactly that. Billy yells out, ""Joel! Wake up! It's raining Datsun cogs!""",Farmer problems (long joke),18

He looks around the room and sees that it is in perfect order; spotlessly clean. He quickly notices that the rest of the house looks extremely clean. He decides to get up and stumbles into the bathroom where he notices he has a very swollen eye that is also black and blue.

After shaving, he goes to the kitchen. As he passes the hall, he sees that the mirror is broken. At this point he is very perplexed. He realizes that his son is in the kitchen and is eating a huge breakfast. The man asks his son, ""What happened last night? Why is the house clean and why do I have a black eye?""

The son replies, ""Well dad, last night you came home drunk off your ass. You stumbled into the mirror, broke it, and hit your head on the bedroom doorknob.

post,es0cwk,2qh72,jokes,false,1579637927,https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/es0cwk/end_of_a_journey/,self.jokes,,"Captain Herman Poiter’s day was not off to a good start. The ship had experienced space turbulence throughout the night, and he woke up with a crick in his back from a night of restless sleep. Add the fact that the coffee machine had broken and you had a perfect recipe for a cranky Captain. It really was a shame. Today was supposed to be a day of great joy. After all, it was his last day of work before his retirement. Oh retirement, how he’d wished for it for 40 years. Though, it is quite poetic, he thought to himself, that his last day seems to be as awful as the first. 


Suddenly there was a banging at the door.
“Captain, Captain, there’s an enemy ship rapidly approaching us!”
“What? Don’t fuck with me Johnny. We’re not combat ready! Attacking a retreating ship violates intergalactic law.”
“I don’t know sir! I know you’ve been looking forward to leaving this dump but it seems we can’t have that yet.”
And with a grunt, the Captain marched out of his quarters. Seems today just got worse.
“Alright Johnny, give me a rundown of the situation.”
“They’ll be within firing range in about 2 minutes. We’ve been trying to lose them but they seem to know our every move”
“Then we’ll just have to brace for combat. Has our defensive field been put up?”
“Yes Captain, but the debris field we flew through last night knocked out a couple of our E9s.”
“E9?”
“Come on Captain, the Electrocell 9s. The ones we use to power our defensive field?”
“Why don’t you just call them a battery like a normal person. Man I need to retire away from these nerds”
“Believe me I can’t wait for you to leave either sir, but you need to know that we lost two last night, and we’ve only got four left.”
“Well then we just need to beat them down before our field gets knocked out”


BOOM
An explosion knocked the crew off their feet. 
“What was that! Why didn’t the field hold?”
“Sir, they’ve figured out our technology. They’re directly targeting the E9s!”
“Well this isn’t good. Base has been alerted yeah? They’re not too far away, we just need to last until reinforcements arrive.”
The Captain made his way over to the piloting system. “Move over lad, 40 years on me and I’m still the best pilot in the fleet.”


This day was not about to get any worse. Years of training and experience coursing through his veins, the Captain became one with the ship. Every twist and turn, even the smallest thrust, he became aware of it all. This was his zone, and these rogues were not going to kill him on his last day of work. Flashes of light burst to the sides as he narrowly avoided their missiles. But 40 years takes a toll on one's reflexes. And the Captain was not agile enough.


BOOM BOOM
Two new explosions ricocheted throughout it the bridge. 
“Oh no sir, we’re down to the last E9!”
“We can’t give up. They’re going to have to work to want me dead now.”
But those words of hope were ill timed. 


BOOM
Another explosion sounded. Johnny trembled. “Captain, they’ve knocked out the sixth E9.”",End of a Journey,1

Except one thing:  the Iggly-Piggly worm. There were only 3 left in the world, and he was going to get one of them and put it in his private zoo. So off he went to get one Iggly-Piggly worm.

One of them was in Brazil, so he took his private jet and flew to get the worm. When he got there, he bought the Iggly-Piggly worm for $1,000,000. He was super happy that he finally had the worm. He got on his private jet to get back to his private island. But unfortunately, as the plane was landing, it crashed in the sea! And he swam back to shore, without the Iggly-Piggly worm.

The second worm was in Argentina. Since his plane had crashed, he took his private yacht this time. It took him 3 weeks to reach Argentina, but he was still determined to get the worm. When he got there, he bought the Iggly-Piggly worm for $25,000,000. He was happy, but cautious. He prepared himself for the 3 week journey back to his island. But unfortunately again, the boat crashed, and he swam back to shore, completely horrified that the Iggly-Piggly worm was now at the bottom of the ocean.

The last worm was in Spain, and this time, untrusting if his own private transport, took a commercial flight (First class, of course). And when he got there, he bought the Iggly-Piggly worm for a grand total of $100,000,000! Praying that the plane didn’t crash, he flew back to his island. But this time, fortunately, the plane didn’t crash! He was jumping up and down in joy. He then realised that he really needed to go to the toilet. But since he didn’t want to lose the worm, he brought it with him...

He sat down on the toiled, the Iggly-Piggly worm clutched in his hands. But, most unfortunately of all, he dropped the worm in the toilet! He was clawing to get it out, but in his wild swinging, pressed the flush. And he watched as his life’s goal had been flushed down the toilet. 

So completely devastated and broken, he trudged back to the sink to wash his hands. And as he switched on the tap...

Guess what came out?

Rev. Paisley is taken aback by this and rushes up to the child and says “What the are you doing playing dog shite, young one?!” 
The child turns his head and with a smile on their face responds “I’m trying to make a Catholic, Reverend.”
Ian smiles back and commends the child saying “Good child good child, carry on” and proceeds on his walk.  
  
He comes across a second Protestant child on the walk again this one has a stick and again is playing with dog shite. Rev. Paisley rushes up again and exclaims the same shock saying “Child! Why are you playing with dog shite?!” to which the child turns again smiling and says “I’m trying to make a Catholic.” Ian again smiles down at the child patting them on the head and telling them how clever they are and continues on his way.  
  
A few more minutes pass on his walk and he spots a little Catholic child, as he approaches him he notices that this one is ALSO playing with a stick and dog shite. 

Confused and annoyed he runs up to the child yelling “Hoi you, taig! What the fuck are you doing playing with dog shite around here?!” to which the little Catholic child turns looking confused and says “I’m trying to make a Catholic” this throws Paisley for a moment until he regains his composure and asks nicer this time “why are YOU trying to make a Catholic out of that?” ...

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some mouldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armour blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them to the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the waterline. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the mouldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chilli, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well, the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice-cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angel dust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",A man in a dirty slum heaven,124
